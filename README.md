# 💼 Customer Churn Prediction with Explainability & Streamlit Web App

## 📊 Project Overview

This project predicts customer churn for a bank using machine learning. 
It includes:

✅ **XGBoost Classification Model**  
✅ **SMOTE** for handling imbalanced data  
✅ **SHAP Explainability** to understand predictions  
✅ **Streamlit Web App** for interactive prediction  
✅ **Retention Suggestions** to reduce churn  
✅ **Downloadable Prediction Report**

## 🚀 Features

- Predict if a customer is likely to churn or stay  
- SHAP visualizations to explain the prediction  
- Retention suggestions based on customer profile  
- Clean, interactive web interface  
- Ability to download predictions as a CSV report
